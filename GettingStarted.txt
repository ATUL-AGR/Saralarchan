Requirements for working withteh code
---------------------------------------

IDE : It  is preferable to use Spring Tool Suite 4.

The code is built using graalvm. https://www.graalvm.org/
Download graalvm Java 17 for Windows from https://www.graalvm.org/downloads/#
Install the JDK in a folder of your choice after extracting the downloaded binary into the selected folder (eg: e:\graalvm17).
Use an unzip software to extract the binary. The extracted folder is ready to use. ( eg: the binaries will be extracted into  E:\graalvm17\graalvm-jdk-17.0.7+8.1).

set the PATH environment variable. In windows open the Environment variables setup panel and edit the PATH variabe to incude the path upto the bin folder of teh 
installed graalvm. ( example PATH=E:\graalvm17\graalvm-jdk-17.0.7+8.1;%PATH% ).

set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to incude the path upto the ase folder of the graalvm installation. ( eg: JAVA_HOME=E:\graalvm17\graalvm-jdk-17.0.7+8.1)

( Validating java is installed properly : Open a command prompt and execute 
E:>java -version
output wil be simiar to 
java version "17.0.7" 2023-04-18 LTS
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment Oracle GraalVM 17.0.7+8.1 (build 17.0.7+8-LTS-jvmci-23.0-b12)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM Oracle GraalVM 17.0.7+8.1 (build 17.0.7+8-LTS-jvmci-23.0-b12, mixed mode, sharing)

In case you get a java version which differs from graalvm, it is possible you already have another version of java installed. To give a precedence to 
graalvm , move the path of the graaalvm bin folder up in the order in the PATH variable setting. You can do so by opening the environment variable tab
and changing the order of the pathlets against the PATH variable in the panel for variables setting. 

At this moment the Saralarchan code supports calls to javascript functions from java code. To enable this the js module in graalvm is needed. Thsi can be
added to the graalvm installation by using the following command from the bin folder of graalvm:
E:\graalvm17\graalvm-jdk-17.0.7+8.1>gu install js

pulling the code repository
-----------------------------
install the git software on your workstation

create a directory named saral and change your location to it.
git init .
This will initialise the directory as the base folder.
clone the code locally by using the below link and executig the git clone command.
git clone https://github.com/Infosys/Saralarchan.git
This will copy the remote repository into the local workstation
