# Saralarchan
A platform for rapid microservices development based on declarative constructs. It is a an end point enumeration framework which allows for defining a real time business workflow ( i.e a business use case) using property sheets and without the need to write orchestration code. 

There are a few out of the box adapters added inthe platform for Redis, Rest end point , Azure service bus, and databases. Each of these resources can be invoked by adding instructions in a pseudo language in a property sheet.

New endpoint can be added on the fly and  additional adapters can be created and dropped into the platform. Hot deployment is supported.
This platform is expected to evolve in the community with additional adapters, orchestration  logic and buisness domain use cases.
