# Saralarchan
A platform for rapid microservices development based on declarative constructs. It is an end point enumeration framework which allows for defining a real time business workflow ( i.e. a business use case), using property sheets and without the need to write orchestration code.

There are a few out of the box adapters added in the platform for Redis, Rest end points, Azure service bus, and databases. Each of these resources can be invoked by adding instructions in a pseudo language into the use case property sheet.

New endpoints can be added andÂ  additional adapters can be created and dropped into the platform. Hot deployment is supported.

This platform is expected to evolve in the community with additional adapters, orchestration logic and business domain use cases.

Specifications for adding adapters, building micro communities, and adding intelligence will soon by published.
